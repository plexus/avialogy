	Avialogy (Europe) builds on the premise that there is a relationship between primary systems 
	of aerial commotion and phenomena in the human world. This study interprets movements 
	and relative positions of powered, fixed-wing machines in cruising altitude.

	Avialogy helps navigate through life since 1903.
